# NourishOS Shared Services

Version: 1.0
Module: Shared Platform Services

# 1. Overview

Shared Services provide reusable platform capabilities that can be consumed by every module within NourishOS.

Instead of each module implementing its own:

- Tasks
- Notifications
- Approvals
- Comments
- Attachments

they all use one centralized service.

Benefits:

- Less duplicated code
- Easier maintenance
- Consistent user experience
- Lower Firestore reads
- Better scalability
